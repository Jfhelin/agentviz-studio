# Appendix — How to reproduce

### Tooling

Repository:

```text
Jfhelin/agentviz-studio
```

Branch:

```text
main
```

Install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jfhelin/agentviz-studio.git
cd agentviz-studio
npm install
```

### Test repo

The standard **OctoCat Supply Platform Demo** repo:

- TypeScript
- 8 small repository files in:

```text
api/src/repositories/
```

- Default test repository for agent demos inside GitHub

### Test prompts

Stored in:

```text
.github/prompts/
```

### Raw exports

Stored in:

```text
cost-test-results/raw-exports/*.json
```

One export per run.

### Per-test writeups

Stored as:

```text
cost-test-results/test-NN-<slug>.md
cost-test-results/test-NN-<slug>.json
```

### Procedure

1. Open VS Code Copilot Chat.
2. Start a **new chat** for every run.
3. Select the model before the first prompt.
4. Send exactly one user prompt.
5. Let the agent finish.
6. Export the chat:

```text
copilot_all_prompts_*.json
```

7. Load the export into AGENTVIZ STUDIO.
8. Use Cost Compare to A/B against baseline.
9. Verify the export has:
   - Single user-turn count
   - Single primary model
   - Single prompt hash
   - Expected tool slate — the tools actually sent to the model, not only the tools configured in the workspace
10. Check first-call cache hit rate.
11. If first-call cache hit rate is above 40%, suspect cache pollution and rerun from a colder state.

### Extra checks for `applyTo:` tests

For scoped instruction-file tests, do not infer behavior from token count alone.

1. Add unique sentinel strings to each scoped instruction file.
2. Export the chat and grep the raw JSON for those sentinels.
3. Confirm whether the system prompt contains full file contents or only a manifest of file paths and `applyTo` globs.
4. Count `read_file` calls against `*.instructions.md`.
5. Treat cost deltas as causal only after the export proves which state occurred: full contents in prompt, manifest-only, or manifest plus a later `read_file`.
