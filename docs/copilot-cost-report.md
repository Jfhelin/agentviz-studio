# What Actually Reduces Copilot Chat Cost in VS Code

A hands-on test report on practical cost-saving techniques for GitHub Copilot token-based billing.

We tested several common Copilot Chat cost-saving ideas in VS Code to separate techniques that materially reduce AI Credit consumption from techniques that only shave small amounts off the prompt prefix.

The short version: **model choice and agent behavior matter far more than trimming static prompt text**. Prefix-token savings are measurable, but usually too small to matter unless they also improve the agent’s path through the task.

Several of the most useful findings were not about how to save tokens, but about which assumed cost mechanisms were not actually present in the product surface we tested.

> **Caveat up front.** This is an internal directional report, not a statistically complete benchmark. Every measurement here is N=1 on a single TypeScript test repository, one user, one workspace, one VS Code/Copilot Chat build, and one rate-card snapshot from May 2026. Treat directional findings as useful, exact percentages as illustrative, and policy changes as requiring follow-up validation.

## TL;DR

The main finding is simple:

> **Model choice and agent behavior dominate static token trimming.**

In our VS Code Copilot Chat tests, the only techniques that produced clean, material savings were:

1. **Use Auto model selection where policy allows.**  
   By billing rule, for eligible requests, Auto applies a 0.9× AI Credit multiplier when it selects the same model a user would otherwise choose manually.

2. **Use smaller models for bounded, repetitive, easy-to-verify work.**  
   On our JSDoc workload, Haiku 4.5 cost 59% less than Sonnet 4.5 and produced equal-or-better judged output for this specific task.

The other ideas mostly failed for more interesting reasons than “the savings were small”:

- In tool-rich VS Code workspaces, trimming MCP servers after the fact barely changes prompt cost because the client already caps the tool slate and routes overflow tools lazily.
- Shrinking useful instructions saved a tiny amount of prefix but cost more overall in our run because the agent took an extra step.
- In the build we tested, `applyTo:` worked as a lazy instruction catalog, not an auto-attach cost gate: scoped file contents were not in the exported prompt unless the agent chose to read them.
- Ask Mode had a slightly smaller cold prefix, but its colder cache made it more expensive than Agent Mode in our one-shot test, and it still used tools when the task called for them.

At Sonnet 4.5 input rates, trimming 1,000 uncached prompt tokens saves roughly **0.3 AI Credits**. But one extra primary model call, unnecessary tool loop, or confused agent path can cost several times more than that.

The broader lesson: do not optimize what merely exists in the workspace. Optimize what actually reaches the model, how it is cached, and whether it helps the agent take a shorter path.

The right optimization target is not “shorter prompts.” It is:

> **Fewer wrong turns.**

Practical guidance:

- Use the cheapest capable model.
- Keep useful instructions.
- Keep mandatory guidance always on; use `applyTo:` only for scoped guidance the agent may safely skip.
- Remove irrelevant tools for hygiene, not as a primary cost lever.
- Measure real workflows rather than prompt length alone.

## How to read the numbers

This report mixes four types of evidence. They should not be interpreted the same way.

| Evidence type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Measured** | Derived from raw VS Code Copilot Chat exports. |
| **Mechanical** | Computed from rate-card or billing-rule behavior. |
| **Inferred** | Based on export inspection and observed behavior. |
| **Illustrative** | N=1 result; useful directionally, not statistically stable. |

Costs in this report are reported in **AI Credits (cr)**, the unit GitHub Copilot is moving to for billing.

For cost intuition, this report approximates:

> **1 AI Credit ≈ $0.01 USD equivalent**

---

## Summary table

Each row shows the technique’s effect under two different test conditions:

- **Hello world** — one minimal prompt, one minimal reply. This isolates prompt-prefix cost before the agent has taken any action.
- **Real workload** — the agent runs the task end-to-end. Cache state, tool choice, and behavioral drift dominate.

All hello-world prefix-tax numbers below assume Sonnet 4.5.

| # | Technique | Hello world | Real workload | Recommendation | Confidence |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| [1](#1-enable-auto-model-selection) | **Enable Auto model selection** | n/a — billing rule, not measured token effect | −10% per eligible request when Auto selects the same model | **Turn on where policy allows. Override when needed.** | High, billing-rule dependent |
| [2](#2-use-a-smaller-model-for-routine-tasks) | **Use a smaller model for routine tasks** | ≈ −67% per call from Sonnet 4.5 to Haiku 4.5 by rate card | **−59% cost and equal-or-better quality on JSDoc task** | **Use smaller models for bounded, repetitive work.** | Medium |
| [3](#3-trim-unused-mcp-servers) | Trim unused MCP servers | In our tool-rich setup, 182 available tools vs 52 built-ins changed the selected slate more than the prompt size; observed delta was only **308 tokens / 0.09 cr** and opposite the naive expectation | Behavior dominated; selected slate changed agent path | Audit for slate quality, not primarily for cost | Medium |
| [4](#4-shrink-your-always-on-instructions) | Shrink always-on instructions | −320 tokens/call ≈ **−0.10 cr** | Net **+13.9%** cost in this run | Do not shrink useful guidance for cost | Medium-low |
| [5](#5-scope-context-with-applyto-globs) | Scope context with `applyTo:` globs | No valid auto-attach prefix-tax result: scoped contents were cataloged, not inlined | Cost A/B not interpretable; the agent made 144 `read_file` calls but none on `*.instructions.md` | Use for optional guidance only; verify exported `read_file` behavior before claiming savings | High for tested build, unknown beyond it |
| [6](#6-use-ask-mode-for-one-shot-questions) | Use Ask Mode for one-shot questions | −1,178 tokens / **−0.35 cr** on a cold first call | In our one-shot test, Ask Mode cost **+44%** because its cache was colder; in a tool-using workload, modes were near-equivalent | Pick mode for UX and behavior, not expected savings | Medium-low |

## What to tell customers

### Safe guidance

- Start with **model selection**. Use smaller models for bounded, repetitive, easy-to-check tasks.
- Enable **Auto model selection** where policy allows.
- Optimize instructions for **clarity and task success**, not raw token count.
- Keep MCP server lists relevant and well-described so the client's tool-selection slate stays composed of tools you actually want the agent to reach for. Do not position MCP trimming as a major cost lever.
- Treat `applyTo:` instruction files as optional, lazily fetched guidance. Keep mandatory rules in always-on instructions.
- Do not assume a lighter-looking mode is materially cheaper; choose the mode that fits the task.
- Measure real workflows, not just configured prompt length or tool count.
- Treat token savings and behavioral savings as different things.

### Avoid these claims

These claims are too broad or misleading:

- “Shorter instructions always save money.”
- “Ask Mode is cheaper.”
- “Ask Mode is a no-tools mode.”
- “`applyTo:` reliably reduces token cost.”
- “Fewer configured tools automatically means a cheaper prompt.”
- “Output formatting is the main cost lever.”
- “Haiku is better than Sonnet.”
- “These percentages will generalize to every repo.”
- “Tokens in instructions are free.”

The better message is:

> Useful cached prefix tokens are usually cheaper than the extra iterations caused by missing guidance.

## Three things to do today

1. **Enable Auto model selection where policy allows.**  
   It is a low-friction cost lever for eligible requests and reduces organization-wide drift toward always using the most expensive model.

2. **Default routine work to a smaller model.**  
   Haiku 4.5 delivered the measured win in this report; GPT-5 mini is even cheaper by rate card and is a candidate for the same task class. Use smaller models for bounded, repetitive, easy-to-check tasks such as documentation, boilerplate, simple transformations, and summarization. Escalate to stronger models for debugging, architecture, security-sensitive work, and ambiguous multi-step tasks.

3. **Optimize instructions for behavior, not length.**  
   Do not remove useful repo guidance just to save a few hundred prefix tokens. Instead, remove stale or contradictory instructions and add concise guidance that prevents unnecessary exploration.

## Cost levers, ranked

From most reliable to least reliable:

| Rank | Cost lever | Why it matters |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | **Choose the right model** | Biggest predictable impact. |
| 2 | **Avoid unnecessary agent iterations** | Biggest behavioral impact. |
| 3 | **Keep context useful and cacheable** | More important than making it tiny. |
| 4 | **Improve what actually reaches the model** | Better than merely shrinking configured context or tool count. |
| 5 | **Trim truly irrelevant prefix** | Real but usually small once caching and tool budgeting are in play. |
| 6 | **Format output tersely** | Useful for UX; usually not the main cost lever. |

---

## Decision matrix

| Workload type | Suggested default | Why |
|---|---|---|
| JSDoc, comments, boilerplate | Haiku 4.5 / GPT-5 mini | Low-risk, easy to verify |
| Summarization of known files | Smaller model first | Usually bounded |
| Simple code transformations | Smaller model, escalate if needed | Cost-efficient and easy to check |
| Debugging failing tests | Sonnet / stronger model | Reasoning-heavy |
| Security-sensitive code review | Stronger model | Error cost is high |
| Multi-file architecture change | Stronger model, or Auto if it selects one | Planning and consistency matter |
| One-shot explanation / conversational Q&A | Ask Mode | UX and interaction fit; not a cost lever |
| Autonomous edits | Agent Mode | Workflow fit |

# Deep dives

Each deep dive follows the same structure:

1. What the technique claims to save.
2. What hello-world prefix measurement showed.
3. What the real workload showed.
4. What to take away.

The important pattern:

> Prefix-tax savings are real but small. Behavioral changes are larger and less predictable.

---

## 1. Enable Auto model selection

We did not A/B test Auto because its primary cost effect is a billing/routing rule rather than a token-count effect.

For eligible requests, Auto receives a **0.9× AI Credit multiplier** compared with manually selecting the same model. That means if Auto selects the same appropriate model a user would have chosen manually, the direct saving is **10%**.

The larger operational benefit is behavioral: Auto reduces the chance that broad populations default to the most expensive available model for routine work. At enterprise scale, that habit is likely more expensive than small differences in prompt prefix.

> **Caveat:** This recommendation assumes Auto is enabled for the relevant Copilot surface and that its model choice is acceptable for the workload. Users should still override when task risk, model capability, or customer policy requires a specific model.

### Takeaway

Turn on Auto model selection where policy allows. Override per prompt when there is a specific reason to use a particular model.

---

## 2. Use a smaller model for routine tasks

> **The headline win of this report.**

Smaller model selection is not a prefix-token technique. The prompt may be the same, but the rate card is different.

| Model | Input cost | Output cost | Hi-prompt cost, cold cache |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Sonnet 4.5 | $3/M tok | $15/M tok | ≈ **5.27 cr/call** |
| Haiku 4.5 | $1/M tok | $5/M tok | ≈ **1.76 cr/call** |
| GPT-5 mini | $0.25/M tok | $2/M tok | ≈ **0.44 cr/call** |

Mechanical deltas:

- Sonnet 4.5 → Haiku 4.5: **≈ −67% per call**
- Sonnet 4.5 → GPT-5 mini: **≈ −92% per call**

The open question is not whether the model is cheaper. It is whether the model is good enough for the task.

### Real workload: JSDoc task

Same prompt, same test repo, same files. Two clean exports.

| KPI | Sonnet 4.5 | Haiku 4.5 | Delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Total cost | 20.7 cr | 8.4 cr | **−59%** |
| Cost per LLM call | high | low | **−74%** |
| Output tokens | 5,760 | 7,544 | +31% |
| Primary LLM calls | 3 | 4 | +33% |
| Tool calls | 9 | 16 | +78% |
| Cache hit rate | 67% | 68% | flat |

Quality was hand-graded using a 5-axis rubric, blind to cost.

| Output dimension | Sonnet 4.5 | Haiku 4.5 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Code blocks produced | 16 | 24 |
| Completion | 67%, skipped 8 class declarations | **100%** |
| Per-block quality | 7/10 average | 8/10 functions, 3/10 classes |
| Total quality units | 11.2 q | 18.0 q, function-weighted |

Cost-quality grid:

| Model | Completion | Per-block quality | Total quality units | Cost | Quality per credit |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Sonnet 4.5 | 16/24 (67%) | 7.0/10 | 16 × 7 = **112** | 20.7 cr | **5.4 q/cr** |
| Haiku 4.5 | 24/24 (100%) | 6.3/10 | 24 × 6.3 = **151** | 8.4 cr | **18.0 q/cr** |

On this task, Haiku produced **roughly 3.3× more quality per credit** (18.0 ÷ 5.4).


### What this does and does not prove

This does **not** prove that Haiku is better than Sonnet.

It proves something narrower and more useful:

> Smaller models can be dramatically more cost-efficient on repetitive, bounded, low-judgment tasks.

The measured task was JSDoc generation. That is structured, easy to verify, and has a clear completion target. The result should not be generalized to debugging, architecture, security-sensitive review, or ambiguous multi-step work without further testing.

### What a clean follow-up test should measure

This test was relatively clean, but N=1 still matters.

A stronger follow-up would measure the same model comparison across:

- JSDoc generation
- Multi-file refactor
- Failing test debugging
- Security review
- Feature implementation
- Code explanation/summarization

The most important unknown is whether smaller-model iteration overhead grows on reasoning-heavy tasks.

### Takeaway

Use Haiku 4.5 or GPT-5 mini for bounded, repetitive, easy-to-verify work such as:

- Documentation generation
- Boilerplate
- Simple transformations
- Summarization
- Low-risk refactoring

Use stronger models for:

- Debugging
- Architecture
- Security-sensitive analysis
- Ambiguous multi-step tasks
- Work where a wrong answer is expensive to detect

The best default is not “always use the cheapest model.” It is:

> Use the cheapest capable model.

## 3. Trim unused MCP servers

### Test setup

Two conditions on the same task: full MCP set (182 tools available across Azure, GitHub, Playwright, built-in) vs audited-down to the 52 built-in tools only.

### Hello world: minimal A/B

First-primary-call input tokens, Sonnet 4.5, prefix-tax only:

| Condition | Available tools | Tools sent to model | First-call input tokens | First cold-call cost |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Full MCP set | 182 | 25 | 17,217 tok | ≈ **5.17 cr** |
| Built-in tools only | 52 | 26 | 17,525 tok | ≈ **5.26 cr** |
| Delta | +130 tools | −1 tool | **−308 tok** | **≈ −0.09 cr / cold call** |

The 182-tool run was actually 308 tokens *cheaper*, and the entire delta traces to one tool: `explore_subagent` was in the 52-tool slate but not the 182-tool slate. Adding more candidate tools displaced a useful built-in.

### Why the prompt barely moves

VS Code Copilot Chat doesn't put every available tool into the prompt. It runs a tool-budget system that caps how much tool surface the model ever sees:

- The slate sent to the model is capped (in the build we tested, around 88 tool slots per call).
- Once the available-tool count crosses roughly 64, the client starts bundling overflow tools behind small "router" tools. The model can still reach the bundled tools — it just has to call the router first to expand them. The catalog is reachable, not inlined.
- A budget split divides those slots between built-in tools and each MCP server, so adding more MCP toolsets shrinks the share built-in tools get. This is what displaced `explore_subagent` in our 182-tool run.

The practical consequence: trimming MCP servers from a tool-heavy setup gives almost no prefix saving, because the cap is already doing the work. **Staying lean from the start does help**, though — below the grouping threshold, tools are inlined verbatim, and each one costs roughly **~235 tokens / ~0.07 cr per cold call**.

### Real workload: JSDoc task

Net cost was **+17.1%** in the audited condition — the opposite direction from the prefix-tax prediction. With a different selected slate, the agent picked a different path. Behavioral drift swamped the tiny prefix saving.

### Practical guidance

Do:

- Be deliberate at install time. Don't enable MCP servers you won't use.
- Audit existing MCP setups for noisy, broken, or irrelevant tools — treat it as a quality fix.

Do not:

- Try to optimise MCP for cost after the fact in a tool-rich workspace. The cap eats your savings.
- Don't toggle MCP servers mid-session just to "tidy up." VS Code intentionally keeps the tool slate stable across calls so the prefix cache stays warm — in our test, a UI toggle didn't even propagate to the slate the model received, and that's by design.
- Compare runs without checking whether the slate (what the model actually saw) changed.

### Takeaway

Audit MCP servers for **slate quality**, not for token cost.

In any tool-rich VS Code Copilot Chat setup, the prompt-size effect of trimming is small or zero — the client already caps the slate and routes large catalogs through lazy router tools. The real risks of an unaudited MCP setup are downstream:

- **Wrong-tool risk:** noisy or duplicate tools can displace better tools from the slate, and the agent picks the wrong one.
- **Expansion overhead:** when the right tool isn't in the slate, the agent has to call a router to expand a group before it can use it. That's an extra LLM round-trip, plus a permanent bump in prefix size for the rest of the session.

Both of these cost more than the prefix tokens you'd save by trimming.

Other IDEs and surfaces likely behave differently. Always inspect the export.

## 4. Shrink your always-on instructions

### Hello world: minimal A/B

Cut the project’s `instructions.md` from baseline to a deliberately trimmed version. First-primary-call input tokens, Sonnet 4.5:

| Condition | First-call input tokens | First cold-call cost |
|---|---:|---:|
| Baseline | 17,580 tok | ≈ **5.27 cr** |
| Trimmed | 17,260 tok | ≈ **5.18 cr** |
| Delta | **−320 tok, −1.82%** | **≈ −0.10 cr/call** |


This is the same order of magnitude as the MCP audit hello-world result. Instructions were only a small fraction of the prompt prefix. For subsequent calls that hit the prompt cache, only the uncached portion is billed at the full input rate; cached prefix tokens are billed at the lower cached-token rate.

### How we compressed the instructions

For this test, we compressed `copilot-instructions.md` using purely subtractive edits. The goal was to match the source guide’s suggested “40–60% fewer instruction tokens” target without rewriting the actual rules or adding new guidance.

The file shrank from **2,975 to 1,541 characters**, a **48% reduction**. We removed section preambles, duplicated guidance, courtesy wording, redundant blank lines, repeated meta-instructions, and code-discoverable architecture descriptions. We kept the important landmines verbatim: custom error type names, build commands, walkthrough-writer skill guidance, the `applyTo` split convention, and other rules the agent could not reliably infer from code.

### Real workload: JSDoc task

Same task, baseline vs trimmed instructions:

| KPI | Baseline | Trimmed | Delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Total cost | low | higher | **+13.9%** |

The cost increase came from the agent doing more exploration with less guidance:

- More file reads
- More back-and-forth
- One extra primary LLM call

The trimmed instructions removed context the agent appeared to rely on.

The net cost increase was much larger than the prefix saving.

### Better framing

The wrong optimization target is:

> Shorter instructions.

The right optimization target is:

> Instructions that reduce avoidable agent work.

### Good instruction changes

Useful changes include:

- Remove stale or contradictory guidance.
- Replace verbose prose with precise rules.
- Add project-specific conventions that prevent exploration.
- Include known test commands, build commands, and repo layout.
- Add “do not touch” constraints that prevent unnecessary file reads.
- Keep examples that help the agent make fewer wrong turns.

### Bad instruction changes

Risky changes include:

- Removing useful repo context to save a few hundred tokens.
- Compressing guidance so much that it becomes ambiguous.
- Deleting examples the agent relies on.
- Removing task constraints that prevent unnecessary exploration.
- Optimizing for token count instead of task success.

### Confounds

Two confounds remain:

1. **Cache state**  
   The baseline run may have primed the cache for the trimmed run’s first call.

2. **N=1 behavioral effect**  
   The +13.9% increase comes from a single pair of runs.

A cleaner test would run N≥5 fresh-cache pairs and report median and spread.

### Takeaway

Do not shrink instructions for cost reasons.

Shrink instructions when they are:

- Confusing
- Redundant
- Contradictory
- Stale
- Too vague to guide the agent

Keep useful instructions even if they add a few hundred prefix tokens. Useful cached prefix tokens are usually cheaper than the extra iterations caused by missing guidance.

## 5. Scope context with `applyTo:` globs

### What this technique is supposed to do

Custom instruction files in VS Code Copilot Chat (`.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`) carry an `applyTo:` front-matter glob. The popular framing: a file with `applyTo: "src/frontend/**"` only applies when the agent works on matching files, and non-matching files don't get billed.

### What we wanted to measure

Two questions, in order:

1. **How does the mechanism work?** Are scoped contents auto-attached when the glob matches, or only advertised as metadata?
2. **If content is loaded, how much does it save** compared with keeping the same rules always on?

The cost question only matters after the export shows whether scoped contents are auto-attached, cataloged, or lazily fetched.

### What we found

The mechanism exists, but not the way the popular framing suggests.

The harness injects a small **catalog** into the system prompt — one entry per scoped instruction file (file path + glob) — and tells the agent: *"if relevant to the current task, call `read_file` to load it. Don't eagerly load all instructions upfront."*

So `applyTo:` is an **opt-in catalog**, not an auto-attach. The agent decides per turn whether the glob matches, whether it's relevant, and whether to spend a `read_file` call to pull the content in. In our test run the agent made 144 `read_file` calls and zero on any `*.instructions.md` file, even with a matching glob. The rules silently never fired because the agent never asked for them.

### Takeaway

`applyTo:` *can* reduce the always-on prefix compared with putting the same rules in `copilot-instructions.md` — scoped contents are not paid on every call.

But it is **agent-discretion, not guaranteed application**. The agent has to notice the glob applies, decide it is relevant, and spend a `read_file` call. If the agent never fetches the file, the cost saving comes with missing guidance.

Practical guidance:

- If a rule **must** apply, keep it in `copilot-instructions.md`. You pay the tokens on every call, but you know it fired.
- If a rule is **nice-to-have when relevant**, scoping it with `applyTo:` can avoid always-on tokens — but expect the agent to skip it sometimes.
- Verify by exporting a chat and checking whether the `read_file` call on your instruction file actually happened.

The deeper lesson:

> Verify the mechanism end-to-end before claiming a saving. We almost shipped "applyTo: doesn't work" when the truer story is "applyTo: works as a catalog, but the agent has discretion to ignore it."

Caveats: single test run, source-code check limited to the `vscode-copilot-chat` extension repo. Treat as a strong working hypothesis, not a proof.

---

## 6. Use Ask Mode for one-shot questions

### What this technique is supposed to do

Ask Mode is a separate chat mode in VS Code Copilot Chat. The intent: a lighter-weight surface for one-shot questions — explanations, code reading, quick Q&A — that loads no tools and skips the agent scaffolding, and therefore costs less per call than Agent Mode.

### What we wanted to measure

Two questions:

1. **Is Ask Mode structurally lighter than Agent Mode** in current VS Code Copilot Chat — smaller prompt, no tool definitions, no tool use?
2. If so, **how much does it actually save per call**?

### Hello world: minimal A/B

Same one-shot question sent in Agent Mode vs Ask Mode, fresh chat in each:

| Condition | First-call input tokens | First cold-call cost |
|---|---:|---:|
| Agent Mode | 21,378 tok | ≈ **6.41 cr** |
| Ask Mode | 20,200 tok | ≈ **6.06 cr** |
| Delta | **−1,178 tok, −5.5%** | **≈ −0.35 cr/call** |

Ask Mode's first-call prefix is genuinely smaller — fewer tool definitions, slightly shorter system prompt — but the saving is modest: about 5%, not the order-of-magnitude difference the "lighter mode" framing suggests.

### Real workload: normal usage

In real usage, even this small structural saving is erased by cache asymmetry.

Anthropic's prompt cache is keyed on prefix bytes per API credential. Agent Mode and Ask Mode build different prefixes, so they get **independent cache entries**. In our test, even after restarting VS Code and starting a fresh chat:

- Agent Mode came up at ~50% cache hit on the first call.
- Ask Mode came up at ~14%, with the first primary call at 0%.

The reason: Agent Mode is the prefix the user already hammers every day, so its cache entry is continuously refreshed by ordinary work. Ask Mode prefixes are rarely warm because Ask Mode is, by design, used sporadically for one-shots.

Net effect on Pair 1 (single-call Q&A):

- Total cost A: **6.10 cr**
- Total cost B: **8.78 cr** (+44%)

Ask Mode pays roughly **50% more per token** in the cold-start single-call case. The structural −5.5% prefix saving is dwarfed by the cache penalty.

### The Ask Mode surprise: it is not a no-tools mode

The bigger structural finding came from a second test designed to *tempt* tool use — a cross-file exploration question:

| Mode | Tool calls | Distinct tools used |
|---|---:|---|
| Agent Mode | 14 | 3 |
| Ask Mode | **11** | **4** (added `semantic_search`) |

Ask Mode invoked `semantic_search`, `read_file`, and other tools to answer the question. There is no agent overhead being skipped at the prompt level — 98% of the system prompt is shared between the two modes — and Ask Mode will reach for tools when the question seems to need them.

In multi-call workloads like this one, the cache asymmetry shrinks (both runs hit ~86–91% cache mid-run), so total cost was within noise: 18.2 cr vs 19.1 cr.

### Practical guidance

Use Ask Mode when:

- You want to discourage edits without disabling them.
- You prefer the more conversational answer style.

Use Agent Mode when:

- You want autonomous edits or commands.
- You want to benefit from the warm prefix you've already built up today.

Do **not** pick Ask Mode expecting it to be cheaper, tool-free, or structurally different from Agent Mode. In the build we tested, it is essentially the same product surface with a slightly trimmed prompt and a colder cache.

### Takeaway

For both prompt designs we tested, Ask Mode and Agent Mode are functionally and economically equivalent.

The two modes share ~98% of the system prompt, Ask Mode loads only ~13–38% fewer tool definitions depending on call shape, and the cold-start cache penalty for Ask Mode can make it *more* expensive per call than Agent Mode for one-shot questions.

Pick the mode that fits the task, not the mode that "saves tokens."

The methodology lesson:

> First-call cache hit rate is one of the best indicators that a cost benchmark is contaminated — and that asymmetry is sometimes structural, not fixable.

## What we didn't test, and why

Six other ideas came up but were not measured. Each rejection is itself a finding.

| Technique | Why we didn't test |
|---|---|
| Code-only responses | Output tokens were 10–20% of total cost across our runs. Even an aggressive 50% output cut would shave 5–10% at most, and only on workflows that produce long prose. Not a primary lever for agentic coding tasks. |
| Bullets over paragraphs | Same ceiling as code-only responses — operates on the output share, which is 10–20% of cost in our data. May still be worth doing for readability, but should not be sold as a billing lever. |
| Be precise in prompts | Hard to isolate at N=1. Almost certainly one of the most important *behavioral* levers — precise framing reduces exploration, wrong edits, and clarification turns — but it shows up in path drift, not in token counts. Needs a separate task-suite evaluation with a quality rubric. |
| Retune prompts to target model | Requires a stable target model, a corpus of tasks, and a quality rubric independent of the model under test. Same N=1 problem as test #5 (Ask Mode) — model-specific tuning cannot be scored without controlling for what the model would have done untuned. |
| `/chronicle improve` weekly | Effect is on *future* sessions, not the one being measured. A one-off A/B has no observable signal; needs long-horizon evaluation across many real sessions. |
| CodeAct for long tool chains | Not exposed as a user-toggleable mode in VS Code Copilot Chat. No mechanism to A/B without forking the client. |

> Auto model selection was also not A/B tested — see deep dive [#1](#1-enable-auto-model-selection) for why it is a billing lever rather than a token-count lever, and what to expect from it.

The pattern:

- Many proposed token-saving techniques operate on parts of the request that do not drive most cost in agentic workflows. Input, cached context, and tool definitions dominate; the output share is small and behavioral drift swamps it.
- Some require infrastructure the user cannot control.
- Some may help UX or quality but should not be sold as primary billing levers.

# Methodology

The full methodology — tooling, units, workload rationale, the five traps, and the quality grading rubric can be found here
> [methodology.md](methodology.md).

This covers:

- Tooling and units (AGENTVIZ STUDIO, AI Credits)
- What "hello world" and "real workload" mean
- The test workload (JSDoc on the OctoCat Supply demo) and why we chose it
- What the workload misses, alternatives we considered, and what an ideal test program would look like
- The five traps that contaminate Copilot cost benchmarks
- The quality grading rubric used in the model-comparison test

## Final recommendation

For Copilot token-based billing, the highest-value cost controls are not micro-optimizations of prompt text.

They are:

1. **Model routing**  
   Use Auto and smaller models where suitable.

2. **Task shaping**  
   Give the agent enough context to avoid wrong turns.

3. **Workflow fit**  
   Choose the mode for the behavior and UX you want, not because you expect a cheaper prompt.

4. **Tool hygiene**  
   Keep the active tool slate relevant, not merely small.

5. **Measurement discipline**  
   Compare real exported runs and inspect cache state.

6. **Mechanism verification**  
   Before optimizing a setting, verify that it actually changes what reaches the model.

The practical message is:

> Do not look for “shorter prompts” as the main cost story. Ensure **right model, right task, right context, right slate, fewer iterations**.
